A language model is a neural network that predicts the next token given previous tokens.
Modern large language models are usually based on the Transformer architecture.
They are trained on large text corpora and can perform tasks like question answering, summarization, and translation.
Quantization is often used to make these models more efficient on resource-constrained hardware.
