In my gait analysis project, I used an IMU on the foot to detect gait events such as toe-off and initial contact.
A CNN-BiLSTM model was trained to classify time steps into different gait subphases.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation could be used to build a chatbot that answers questions about the gait pipeline based on documentation and notes.
