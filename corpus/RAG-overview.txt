Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines a retriever and a generator.
The retriever finds relevant documents from a knowledge base.
The generator, usually a language model, uses those documents as context to produce an answer.
RAG is useful when the model needs up-to-date or domain-specific information.
